## üèÅ Running the application

This project was created using TypeScript, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as database. So, make sure do you have the last version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) running localy. The front-end was created using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). And the application was build to run in [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) containers.

Start cloning this repository in you local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/Icaro-pavani/projeto23-drivenops
```

After that, inside the cloned folder, just need to run the command below to build the Docker images and containers.

```
docker-compose up
```

At last, the application will be running in your local machine and the front-end could be accessed by `http:localhost:80`, and the back-end through `http::localhost:5000` .
